# 0x07-Rotate 2D matrix

* This is ome of the ALX interview projects, this task focuses on rotating a matrix by 90Â°

## process
    In order to rotate a matrix, 
    -   we'll first transpose the matrix
    -   then we reverse the tranposed matrix.

    In order to transpose it, we'll interchange it from top left to bottom right.
    By doing that we'll have transposed our matrix.
